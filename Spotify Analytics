# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined the Top 10 songs are by popularity, and who the artists were for each song.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined who the Top 10 artists were.
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined what the average danceability of the Top 10 most popular songs were.
SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined which artisit had the longest song
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

#I determined which 5 songs were the loudest compared to its popularity.
SELECT track_name, id
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness desc
LIMIT 5;

#I determined which 5 songs had the highest energy compared to its popularity. 
SELECT track_name, id
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 5;
